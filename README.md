# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Overview
This repository contains the final capstone project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. By completing this project, I applied various Data Analytics skills and techniques learned throughout the course. As an Associate Data Analyst, I was presented with a business challenge requiring data analysis on real-world datasets.

## Project Tasks
Throughout this project, I performed various tasks that professional data analysts do as part of their jobs, including:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering data from multiple sources.
- **Data Wrangling and Preparation**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the data through summary statistics and visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis and Data Mining**: Applying statistical methods and data mining techniques to uncover insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and plots to visualize the data.
- **Interactive Dashboard Creation**: Building an interactive dashboard to present the findings.

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting and running the analysis.
- **Python Libraries**: Including Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **SQL and Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: For data storage and querying.
- **Business Intelligence (BI) Tools**: Such as IBM Cognos Analytics for dashboard creation.

## Final Deliverable
The project culminates with a presentation of the data analysis report for various stakeholders in the organization. The report includes:

- **Executive Summary**: A brief overview of the findings.
- **Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the data.
- **Conclusion**: Key takeaways and recommendations based on the analysis.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the analysis.
4. View the final report in the `report/` directory.
